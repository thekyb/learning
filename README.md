learning material and documentation


This is originally prepared for my studying meterial, but never used. 
So It will be used as a Assignment report perforce until 2024 04. 
Since the upload assignment is also useful for me eventually, this is a good location to upload.

# As of final assignment in Business Intelligence Programming, the file name is a bit weird. it will be eventually changed to the original name.
  Machine learning instruction code as we as question-answer sheet
  using both linear-regression, Random forest algorism. 

  This is a good example for taking the frame when starting simple machine learning project.
